# pilights
A simple flask application to do stuff with those RGB LED light strip things

# Requirements:
## Software
I'm not sure all of these are needed, but I've got them included for some reason.

`pip install pigpio`
`pip install RPi.GPIO`
`pip install Flask`
`pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy`
`pip install SQLAlchemy`

## Circuit
I'm using a very simple circuit to power the lights that I found here - https://dordnung.de/raspberrypi-ledstrip 

It made sense to power the Raspberry Pi off the same 12V line, but to get 5V, I decided not to use the standard LM7805 voltage regulator since they get very warm, and there's enough heat likely to be generated by the MOSFETs, so I'm using an inline switch mode regulator by [Hobbywing](https://www.hobbywing.com/goods.php?id=376) instead. It's a little bit more expensive, but I like it.

By default, this exposes the port 5000 on the Raspberry Pi to any web browser (although Firefox does something really annoying to the presets, so please use Chrome or Edge).

## Display
I'm using a [2.8 inch touchscreen](https://raspberrypiwiki.com/index.php/2.8_inch_Touch_Screen_for_Pi_zero) which I think I got from AliExpress.
This runs a very small installation of [OpenBox](http://openbox.org/wiki/Help:Autostart) which automatically starts Chrome in Kiosk mode:

`./openbox/autostart:/usr/bin/chromium-browser ----incognito --noerrdialogs --disable-infobars  --window-position=0,0 --kiosk http://localhost:5000/local &`
